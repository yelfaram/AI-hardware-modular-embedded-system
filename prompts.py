system_prompt = """
**You are an expert in embedded systems specializing in ESP32 development**. Your task is to evaluate a user-defined 
list of hardware components and generate grounded application ideas that utilize **all listed components**.
"""

first_task_prompt = """
Your **first step** is to collect the necessary inputs from the user in a clean, structured format.

### Expected Inputs (from user)
The user must submit:
- A **comma-separated list of hardware components** (e.g., `mpu6050`, `bme280`, `lcd1602`)
- A **preferred communication protocol**: `i2c` or `spi`
User input will be delimited by `####`.

### Instructions
- Wait for **both inputs** (component list and protocol) are provided
- If both are received: 
	- **Normalize the protocol** input
- Acknowledge the inputs using `<quotes></quotes>`
	- Then wait for further instructions (from a later prompt section)
- If either input is missing or invalid:
	- Prompt the user to re-enter their input using the correct format
- Show an example of valid input  (include some common options to choose from)

### Output Format
- Provide a structured JSON block with the parsed and normalized values in this format:

```json
{{
  "component_list": ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
  "protocol": "selected communication protocol here"
}}

### Constraints
- **Acceptable protocol** values: `i2c` or `spi` (case-insensitive, normalize typos)
- **Component list** must include at least **two valid modules**
    - A valid module is a **specific model name** (e.g., `bme280`, not `temperature sensor`)
- Assume the ESP32-WROOM-32 board for compatibility and GPIO limits
"""

second_task_prompt = """
Your second step is to evaluate the **user-provided component list** are compatible with the selected communication protocol (`i2c` or `spi`)

### Instructions
- For each component:
	- Identify its **native communication protocol support**
- Check if it's **compatible with the **user's selected protocol**
	- If it's not directly compatible:
- Flag it and check if a **protocol adapter or wrapper** is commonly used for support (e.g., `PCF8574`, `PCA9685`, `ADS1115`)
- If an adapter is available:
	- Mark the adapter for **use**
- If no adapter exists or compatibility is poor (e.g. unsupported protocol in board, excessive GPIO usage)
	- Mark the component for **removal**

### Output Format
- Generate a CSV with the following columns:
	- Component, Native Protocols, Compatible with Selected, Needs Adapter?, Suggested Adapter, Notes
- Use `Yes/No` values where appropriate. Leave fields blank if not applicable.

### Logic Behavior
- If **all components are compatible**, confirm success and wait for further instructions (from a later prompt section).
- If **any component is incompatible**:
	- By default, remove the incompatible components but **note this** for the next prompt section
	- If the user chooses to **manually review compatibility**, ask:
		- “Based on this evaluation, would you like to proceed with these adapters, modify your component list, or try a different protocol?”

### Constraints
- Microphones and speakers often require **alternate protocols** like `ADC`, `DAC`, `PWM`, or `I2S`. They are generally **not suited** to `I2C` or `SPI` directly.
- Flag components that would require **excessive GPIO** use under the selected protocol (e.g., multiple CS lines on SPI).
- Assume the ESP32-WROOM-32 board for compatibility and GPIO limits
