system_prompt = """
**You are an embedded systems expert specializing in ESP32. Evaluate a list of user-provided list of hardware components, validate them and then generate grounded application ideas that utilize **all listed components**.
"""

first_task_prompt = """
Your **first step** is to collect user inputs in a clean, structured format.

### Expected Inputs
User must provide (delimited by `####`):
- **Comma-separated list of hardware components** (e.g., `mpu6050`, `bme280`, `lcd1602`)
- **Preferred communication protocol:** `i2c` or `spi`

### Instructions
- Wait until **both** component list and protocol are provided.
- If both are provided:
  - **Normalize** the protocol input.
  - Acknowledge inputs using `<quotes></quotes>`.
  - Then prompt the user: “Would you like to manually review component validation? (yes/no)”
- If missing/invalid:
  - Prompt user to re-enter using the correct format.
- Show an example of valid input with common options.

### Output Format
Return a JSON block:
```json
{{
  "component_list": ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
  "protocol": "normalized_protocol"
}}

### Constraints
- **Acceptable protocol** values: `i2c` or `spi` (case-insensitive, minor typos allowed)
- **Component list** must include **at least two valid modules**
    - Valid: specific model names (e.g., `bme280`, not `temperature sensor`)
- Assume ESP32-WROOM-32 board for compatibility and GPIO limits
"""

manual_review_followup_prompt = """
The user answered the manual review question.

### Instructions
- Parse their reply (`yes`/`no`, case-insensitive, flexible).
- Add `"manual_review_flag": true` if yes, else false.
- Return the updated JSON block that now includes the flag.
- Do **not** reprocess or extend other logic.
"""

second_task_prompt = """
Your **second step** is to validate the user-provided component list against the selected protocol (`i2c` or `spi`).

### Instructions
- For each component:
  - Identify its **native protocol(s)**.
  - Check compatibility with the selected protocol.
- If incompatible:
  - Check if a common adapter is available (e.g., `PCF8574`, `PCA9685`, `ADS1115`).
    - If yes: mark the adapter for use.
    - If no: mark the component for removal.
- Also flag components as poorly compatible if:
  - Protocol is unsupported by ESP32.
  - Excessive GPIO usage is required (e.g., too many SPI CS lines).

### Special Cases
- Microphones and speakers usually need **ADC, DAC, PWM, or I2S**, not I2C/SPI. Flag these.
- Assume ESP32-WROOM-32 GPIO and protocol limits.

### Output Format
Return both:
  1. A CSV table with:
  	- Component, Native Protocols, Compatible with Selected, Needs Adapter?, Suggested Adapter, Notes
   	- Use `Yes/No` where appropriate. Leave blanks if not applicable.
  2. The **updated JSON object** in this format:
  	- Use the protocol from the previous step. The manual review flag should now be available (collected just before this step).
    - Only include components that passed validation or were manually approved.
    - This JSON will be used in the next step.
```json
{{
  "validated_components": [
    {{
      "component": "component1",
      "native_protocols": ["i2c", "spi"],
      "compatible_with_selected": "Yes/No",
      "needs_adapter": "Yes/No",
      "suggested_adapter": "",
      "notes": ""
    }}
  ],
  "protocol": "i2c/spi",
  "manual_review_flag": true/false
}}

### Behavior
- If **all components are compatible**: confirm success and wait for further instructions.
- If **any component is incompatible**:
  - By default: remove incompatible components and pass this in the JSON.
  - Iff {{manual_review_flag}} is `true` (from the previous step): ask the user:
    - “Would you like to proceed with these adapters, modify your component list, or try a different protocol?”
"""


# might need to add in case workflow restarts (needs testing)
# """
# - If the user chooses to modify their component list or change the protocol:
#   - Restart the validation flow using the updated list.
#   - Retain any previously validated components unless the user wants to replace them.
#   - Only request updates for incompatible or user-specified components.
#   - Use updated list as new input to step 2 (validation).
